      <body>Professional, productive, driven by self-improvement and is confident in learning new concepts. Has a strong passion for developing software in any environment or language.

      <h2>Professional Skills</h2>
      <body>I like to think that I specialize in Mobile and Cloud development. But my day to day often changes based on the tasks at hand. I'm comfortable in Java, Javascript, Dart, Swift, and Node.js for now. That's the best part about programming for me, I can confidently say that I know 7 languages and that's barely scratching the surface. There are so many available languages and tech out there and I can't wait to have an opportunity to explore every last one of them. Programing may be my job but it was and always will be my passion first and foremost.</body>

        <h2>Tech Overview</h2>
        <body>This is a Java-based Android application that uses ARCore and geolocations to show augmented projections of where a rocket is going to take off from. The backend is ran using Firebase. The rocket launch data is coming from a rocket API source that includes details about the launch itself. Also, there is a Pinterest-like image sharing part of the application to share your pictures of the rocket launches(I currently have the 'sharing' part disabled, because.. money).</body>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <body>The goal of this application is to provided users with the ability to stay up to date on rocket launches taking place and make the process of viewing the launch a breeze. It will allow users to see when a rocket launch will take place then see the launch pad in their camera using AR technology. This will allow the user to know exactly where to look when the rocket is about to launch so they never miss a moment. It also will suggest restaurants nearby the rocket launch that offer deals for people wanting to view the launch.</body>
